# guitar_signal_processing
This project's aim is to process an input signal from a guitar to visualize its volume gain in [dB] as well as the frequency spectrum using the Fourier Transform (in this case the FFT)

## Libraries
numpy as np
pyaudio as pau
struct
matplotlib.pyplot as plt
time

## The goal in detail
I intend on testing a DYI wah-wah pedal, developed for private use. I want to pass the signal directly into the mic input of my computer. Then, using PyAudio along with other libraries, the signal should be processed to represent its gain [dB] as well as the frequency spectrum.
